## The smallest good v1
### DORA
- deployment frequency
- lead time for changes
- change fail rate
- failed deployment recovery time
- deployment rework rate

### Reliability
- availability SLI
- latency SLI
- error budget remaining
- burn rate

### CI/CD
- pipeline success rate
- pipeline p95 duration
- broken default branch time
- rerun rate

### Governance
- drift count
- drift age
- policy violation count
- restore test success rate
- certificate expiry window

## Delivery performance (DORA) metrics
### Source
- Kubernetes and Gitlab
### Labels
- service
- environment
- deployment_id
- started_at
- finished_at
- result
- commit_sha    
- pipeline_id
- rollback_of
- incident_id or caused_incident
### Metrics

- hape_worker_busy_ratio{worker_pool}
- hape_resource_saturation_ratio{resource}

## CI/CD pipeline health
- Pipeline success rate
```bash
successful_pipelines / total_pipelines
```
- Pipeline median duration
- Pipeline p95 duration
- Queue/wait time before jobs start
```bash
job_started_at - job_created_at
```
- Deployment job success rate
- Rollback rate
```bash
rollback_deployments / total_deployments
```
- Flaky job rate
```bash
jobs that fail then pass on rerun / total jobs
```
- Rerun rate
```bash
retried_jobs / total_jobs
```
- Manual intervention rate
```bash
manual jobs executed / total pipelines
```
Broken default branch time
```bash
time the default branch stays red
```

## Incident response metrics
- MTTA: mean time to acknowledge
```bash
acknowledged_at - alert_fired_at
```
- MTTM: mean time to mitigate
```bash
mitigated_at - first_user_impact_at
```
- MTTR: mean time to resolve
```bash
resolved_at - first_user_impact_at
```
- Incident recurrence rate
```bash
repeated incidents with same fingerprint / total incidents
```
- Postmortem completion rate
```bash
incidents with postmortem completed / incidents requiring postmortem
```
- Action item closure time
```bash
action_item_done_at - postmortem_created_at
```
- Alert noise rate
```bash
non-actionable alerts / total alerts
```
- Escalation rate
```bash
incidents requiring handoff/escalation / total incidents
```

## Governance and drift metrics
- IaC drift count
```bash
number of resources whose actual config != declared config
```
- Drift age
```bash
now - first_detected_drift_at
```
- Policy violation count
```bash
for example Kyverno/OPA/security/policy failures
```
- Unreviewed production change count
```bash
direct prod changes not linked to reviewed MR
```
- Unsupported version age
```bash
now - vendor end-of-support date
```
- Certificate expiry window
```bash
days until expiry, bucketed by severity
```
- Secret rotation age
- Backup success rate
- Restore test success rate
- Restore test age
```bash
now - last_successful_restore_test_at
```
- Privileged access exception count
- Terraform/Helm drift reconciliation failure rate

## Change-risk and review-quality metrics
- MR size
```bash
changed lines / files / modules
```
- Review latency
```bash
first_review_at - ready_for_review_at
```
- Approval depth
```bash
number of approvers per MR
```
- Time from last approval to merge
- Hotfix rate
```bash
hotfix deploys / total deploys
```
- Revert rate
```bash
reverted merges / total merges
```
Rework after merge
```bash
follow-up fix MRs linked within X days
```
- Change failure probability by MR size bucket
- Change failure probability by service
- Change failure probability by time-of-day/day-of-week

## Developer productivity / developer experience
- time to first review
- time to first successful pipeline
- PR/MR pickup time
- % work blocked
- context-switch count per engineer per week
- docs update rate for infra changes
