# Architecture

Date: 22.02.2026

## Scope
This document describes the high-level architecture for a self-governance DevOps platform with:
- **Automation** (actions/control)
- **Observation** (metrics/visibility)
- **DevOps Platform Agent** (optional orchestrator; TBD)

3rd-party integrations include (examples): Kubernetes, AWS/GCP, Jira/Confluence, GitHub/GitLab, Terraform state.

## Main flows
1) **Observability**
- Metrics collectors read 3rd-party systems (cached + rate-limited) → time-series metrics database scrapes metrics collectors → visualization tool dashboards/alerts

2) **Automation**
- User/Agent → CLI → Python clients → 3rd-party systems (actions/control)

3) **Feedback loop**
- Visualization tool alerts/insights → User/Agent → CLI runs remediation workflows

## Automation Platform

### Components
- **Python Clients Package**
  - Connectors that can **control** and **scrape** 3rd-party systems (actions + reads as needed).
- **CLI**
  - Primary interface for **human** and **AI** interaction.
  - Runs automation workflows and exposes a stable command surface.

### Responsibilities
- Execute operational actions (e.g., remediation, housekeeping, rollout steps).
- Provide a single, auditable execution path (CLI as the choke point).

### Architecture

#### Layers
- **CLI**: Argument parsing and user input handling. Commands call services only.
- **Services**: Domain logic that orchestrates one or more clients to perform automation tasks.
- **Clients**: Low-level adapters for external systems (Jira, Confluence, GitLab, AWS, Kubernetes).
- **Core**: Cross-cutting infrastructure (configuration, logging, centralized error handling). Shared across all layers.
- **Utils**: Shared utilities that are not domain-specific (file management, helpers). Shared across all layers.
  - Formatters live under `utils/formatters/` and are split by target system.

#### Layer Restrictions
- CLI must not call clients directly. All external access goes through services.
- Services may call multiple clients, but clients must not call services.
- Clients must not call other clients.
- Core and utils are reusable by any layer, but should not depend on services or CLI.
- Clients should not import CLI or service code.
- Development-only dependencies must live in `requirements-dev.txt` and be installed in the `.venv` explicitly (do not auto-install in Make targets).
- Configuration is loaded from JSON via `core/config.py`. CLI passes `--config-file-path` to set the config path.

#### General Flow
```mermaid

    userNode[Developer/Engineer] --> cliLayer[CLI Commands]
    cliLayer --> serviceLayer[Services]
    serviceLayer --> clientLayer[Clients]
    clientLayer --> externalLayer[External APIs]
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    coreLayer[Core]
    utilsLayer[Utils]
```

Core and utils are shared across all layers.

#### Directory Layout
- `cli/` → CLI entry and command modules
- `services/` → Domain services (e.g., `changelog_service.py`)
- `clients/` → API clients (e.g., `jira_client.py`, `confluence_client.py`)
- `core/` → Config/logging
- `utils/` → File, shared helpers, formatters
- `docs/` → Architecture and future documentation

#### Naming Conventions
- Clients: `*_client.py`
- Services: `*_service.py`
- CLI commands: `*_commands.py`

#### Example Responsibility Split
- CLI: `jira_commands.py` parses `issue_key`
- Service: `jira_service.py` chooses which Jira API method to call
- Client: `jira_client.py` performs HTTP requests and returns JSON

#### Configuration
- Default config path: `~/.idap/config.json`
- Create config from `.env`: `config init-config-file`
- Commands can override path using `--config-file-path`

## Observation Platform

### Components
- **Metrics Collectors**
  - Read data from 3rd-party APIs and expose metrics for the time-series metrics database.
  - No persistent database. Use caching and rate limiting to keep scrapes stable.
- **Time-Series Metrics Database**
  - Scrapes metrics collectors on a schedule.
- **Visualization Tool**
  - Visualizes metrics and drives alerts.
- **Selected implementations**
  - Prometheus is chosen as the time-series metrics database.
  - Grafana is chosen as the visualization tool.
  - Prometheus exporters are the chosen metrics collectors.

---

## DevOps Platform Agent OR Rule Engine AI (TBD)
- Orchestrator that decides *what to do* and *when to do it*.
- Executes actions only via the **CLI**.
